(Separate meat from stock and reserve stock). Place a large pan on medium heat, add palm nut fruit and dilute with warm water double of the amount of palm fruit used. I used 800g of palm fruit so I added 1.6ltr of water to the pan. You can add any tough beef at this point, this will help soften it more and the flavour infuses as well, palm nut concentrate mixed with water in a pot. Stir till well combined and bring to boil for about 20 minutes. Don't cover the pan with a lid at this point as it would boil over. Put a wooden spoon across the pot to stop this from happening. At this point, you will see the palm fruit extract bubbling and starting to thicken, and the oil floating on top of the soup. Add blended scotch bonnet, assorted beef, periwinkle and cook for another 10-15 minutes. Add Banga spice, oburunbebe stick, grounded crayfish and cook for another 10 minutes. The Banga spice adds a very rich aroma to the soup and you can just smell it. Check for salt and seasoning, dilute the soup with reserved stock if it is too thick. (Stir in between to avoid soup sticking to the bottom of the pan). I left the fresh catfish until the tail end of my cooking because it doesn't take time to cook at all. Add fresh fish and shrimps to the soup, add the beletete leaves or bitter leaf and leave to cook on low heat for another 10-12 minutes. (if you need to stir at any point after you have added the fresh fish, you will need to be careful or you can simply hold the pan on its 2 handles and give it a little twirl). If you want, you can scoop out the floating oil and use it for another Nigerian local dish. Your soup is ready to be served with starch, Eba, fufu, pounded yam or any other swallow of your choice."}

Groundnut soup is a nutty, savory and spicy Nigerian peanut stew commonly eaten for lunch or dinner. In Nigeria, peanut stew or groundnut soup is usually eaten with a carbohydrate like rice or a 'swallow' like eba. While prevalent all over Nigeria, groundnut soup was originally a product of the Northern part of the country where it is natively called 'miyar gyada' and is a common staple in special events such as Weddings and even funerals. I tasted my first groundnut soup as a child in Lagos, (located in the Southwest region of Nigeria) andâ€¦ it was terrible! It was really bad guys, I can't lie. After that first time, it was years till I found my love for groundnut soup again. I have since learned to make peanut stews specific to different West African countries and am excited to start with my home country Nigeria! I had to redeem my Nigerian peanut stew experience and my Lawd, did it turn out right!

If you are cooking goat meat from an older or male goat, you may need to cook the meat for longer for it to be tender. Next, toast the peanuts in a pan, stirring continuously over low heat, till the nuts turn toasty in color. It should take about 15-25 minutes depending on how hot the pan is. Allow the nuts to cool completely before grinding. In a blender, food processor, mortar or pestle, grind the peanuts into a rough powder. Be mindful not to blend into a butter (it really doesn't hurt if blended to a butter, this is just how I learned to do it). Mix the braising liquid from braising the goat meat and water (should make up about 3 cups of liquid) with the grounded peanuts and scotch bonnet peppers in a pot making sure there are no peanut lumps. Bring this mixture to a gentle boil over low-medium heat for about 10 minutes, mixing continuously to prevent burning. At this stage, you may add more or less water depending on the consistency you prefer. If you prefer a lighter soup, add more water. If you prefer a thicker soup add no more water. Note that as the stew continues to cook, it usually thickens up. It also thickens a little more once it cools down. After 10 minutes, add in the palm oil, braised meat, crayfish, and cook for another 5 minutes. Add in the chopped spinach and simmer for 5 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Take the stew off the heat and serve."}

Boil stockfish with beef if you want or you can cook separately with small onions, seasoning and salt till tender. Use freshly grounded ogbono powder, it only takes a few minutes to blend.

        {id: STRING, title: "How To Cook", subject: "You can use frozen okra if that's all you have, but I promise you, fresh okra is so much better. For the longest time, I used frozen, but when I tried it with fresh okra, I realized what I had been missing. You can control just how smooth or chunky you want it to be. To make it very smooth, use a blender and blend till it's pureed. You can also cut it with a knife into smaller pieces to make it chunky, use a grater with a large hole shredder, or chop with a food processor. The easiest and fastest way is to chop with a food processor as this makes the okra chunks uniform in size, and it is ready in about 2 minutes. Cut the assortment of meat you chose into small pieces. Then add some salt, black pepper, seasoning cubes, and enough water and cook until tender. You will need the meat stock to enhance the soup's flavor, so don't toss it. If you're using smoked fish and locust bean, soak them separately in hot water for 5 minutes, break apart the smoked catfish and remove the bones. Then, wash and drain the locust bean. In a large skillet on medium-high heat, add some palm oil. Fry some onions till it just begins to turn brown, then add the chopped okra. Stir in for about 5 minutes, and the okra will start to turn a bit slimy. Add in the meat stock from boiling the meat or just water if you have none. Since the meat stock is usually very flavorful, you might need to add more spices to bring out the flavor if you just use water. Bring to a boil and add the spices, meat, shrimp, bell pepper, smoked catfish, and locust bean. You can add or subtract anything on this list; just make it your own! Add some spinach to make it even more filling. When cooking the okra, let it boil for 5 minutes, then check the texture of the soup with a slotted spoon. At this point, I am usually okay with the texture but if it is too crunchy for you, let it boil for a few more minutes. And now, your okoro soup is ready for eating."}
